[The basic anatomy of a Shiny app]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<p class="body-text bottombr">Shiny apps are composed in *two* parts: [**(1)**]{.teal-text} a **web page** that displays the app to a user (i.e. the **user interface**, or **UI** for short), and [**(2)**]{.teal-text} a **computer** that powers the app (i.e. the **server**)</p>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-alt: "A simple schematic of a Shiny app, which includes the User Interface (UI, colored in blue) and the Server (colored in orange). The UI creates what the user will see and interact with, while the server builds the outputs that react and update based on user inputs."
knitr::include_graphics("images/part1/basic_shiny_app.png")
```

<p class="body-text bottombr">The **UI** controls the **layout and appearance** of your app and is written in HTML (but we use functions from the `{shiny}` package to write that HTML). The **server** handles the **logic** of the app -- in other words, it is a set of instructions that tells the web page what to display when a user interacts with it.</p>

##  {#reactivity-intro data-menu-title="Reactivity Intro"}

[Reactivity: a brief intro]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<p class="body-text bottombr">Reactivity is **what makes Shiny apps responsive** i.e. it lets the app instantly update itself whenever the user makes a change. At a very basic level, it looks something like this:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-alt: "A schematic of Shiny reactivity. The UI is represented by a light blue box. Inside the blue UI box, there is a radio button widget that says, 'Make a choice:' and three round radio buttons beneath it. Underneath that, there is a placeholder space for a reactive output to be created by the server. The server is to the left of the UI and is represented by an orange box. At a basic level, reactivity occurs after the following steps: (1) A widget gets information from a user which (2) is then passed to the server where it is used to update a data frame based on the users choice. (3) The new data frame is used to update outputs in the server, and (4) those outputs are then rendered in the UI."
knitr::include_graphics("images/part1/reactivity-intro.png")
```
