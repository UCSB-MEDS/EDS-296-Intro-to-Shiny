## Prerequisites

[***No prior Shiny experience necessary for this course!***]{.teal-text} However, we do assume that participants have the following:

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) / [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) installed & a basic familiarity with the language  

-  A [GitHub](https://github.com/) profile & [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed / configured

- You have the required R packages installed. You can install/update them all at once by running:
 
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages(pkgs = c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "shinyWidgets", "DT", "leaflet", "shinycssloaders", "tidyverse", "bslib", "fresh", "sass", "reactlog", "shinytest2", "palmerpenguins", "lterdatasampler", "gapminder", "markdown"))

## Reference code

We'll be building / playing with a number of small apps and dashboards throughout this workshop. You can reference the complete source code for each of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/samanthacsik/EDS430-shiny-app). 

We'll be creating our own GitHub repositories to house our apps, so *you do not need to fork this repo* (unless you want to, of course).
