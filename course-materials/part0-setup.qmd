## Prerequisites

-  A [GitHub](https://github.com/) profile & [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed / configured

- You have the required R packages installed. You can install / update them all at once by running:
 
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages(pkgs = c( "tidyverse", "shiny", "shinydashboard", "shinyWidgets", "shinycssloaders", "markdown", "DT", "leaflet", "bslib", "thematic", "fresh", "sass", "reactlog", "shinytest2", "palmerpenguins", "lterdatasampler", "gapminder"))

## Reference code

We'll be building / playing with a number of small apps and dashboards throughout this workshop. You can reference the complete source code for each of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/samanthacsik/EDS430-shiny-app). 

We'll be creating our own GitHub repositories to house our apps, so *you do not need to fork this repo* (unless you want to, of course).
