## Course Description

This website houses materials which accompany the 1-unit, 2-day, hands-on coding workshop, [EDS 296-1W - Intro to Shiny](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/eds-296-1w), offered through the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/), in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).

In this workshop, students will learn how to build and deploy Shiny applications. The [`{shiny}` package](https://shiny.posit.co/) provides a framework that allows R users to build interactive web applications and dashboards, and has become a popular tool for sharing data analyses and data-derived outputs with broad audiences. In this two-part short course, students will learn the fundamentals of reactivity, how to customize an application user interface (UI), best practices and workflows for developing shiny apps, and how to deploy their apps online via RStudioâ€™s hosting service, [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

## Acknowledgements

Building this short course would not have been possible without the incredibly talented members of the R / Shiny / data science community who so willingly share tutorials, examples, and code for others (like myself!) to learn from. Attribution will be included on any slides / materials where content is adapted from other educators.
